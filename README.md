# Omnibang

A very simple Chrome/Firefox extension that enables user to search many websites directly from the address bar.

It is based on [bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bang) provided by DuckDuckGo and works in a similar way. The two main differences are:

- DuckDuckGo follows the format `!bang search-term`, whereas Omnibang follows `! bang search-term`.
- Omnibang works even if DuckDuckGo isn't your default search engine.
